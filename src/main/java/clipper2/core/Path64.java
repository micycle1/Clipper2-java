/**
 * This structure contains a sequence of Point64 vertices defining a single
 * contour (see also terminology). Paths may be open and represent a series of
 * line segments defined by 2 or more vertices, or they may be closed and
 * represent polygons. Whether or not a path is open depends on its context.
 * Closed paths may be 'outer' contours, or they may be 'hole' contours, and
 * this usually depends on their orientation (whether arranged roughly
 * clockwise, or arranged counter-clockwise).
