 * This structure contains a sequence of PointD vertices defining a single

 * represent polygons. Whether or not a path is open depends on its context.
 * Closed paths may be 'outer' contours, or they may be 'hole' contours, and
 * this usually depends on their orientation (whether arranged roughly
 * clockwise, or arranged counter-clockwise).
